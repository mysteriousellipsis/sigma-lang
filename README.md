# sigma by dimini171
rewrite of the [original](https://github.com/dimini171/sigma/tree/v1), now more like an actual language than a preprocessor.  

**this version of sigma is undergoing testing. a stable version can be found [here](https://github.com/dimini171/sigma/tree/v1)**  

## known issues
inline math does not work (e.g. `change count to count minus 1`)  
nested logic does not work (e.g. `((1 is equal to 2) or (2 is equal to 2))`)  

## what is this??
sigma lang was made for our final year computing coursework.  
it attempts to be a very simple to understand and learn, especially for absolute beginners and people who want to pick up programming, but find it too confusing or difficult.

## syntax
head over to [syntax.md](https://github.com/mysteriousellipsis/sigma/blob/v2/SYNTAX.md) to read more

## progress on stuff
### implemented
comments  
variables  
conditionals  
while loops  
user input  
output  


### completed, not tested

### in progress
inline math  
nested logic  

### roadmap
