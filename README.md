# sigma by dimini171
rewrite of the [original](https://github.com/dimini171/sigma/tree/v1), now more like an actual language than a preprocessor.  
an automated installer will be added soon.
you are recommended to use python version 3.13 or higher. **the minimum version is python 3.10**

## quickstart
install python 3.13 if you have not already done so
check out [this document](INSTALLPYTHON.md)

go to [the latest release](https://github.com/dimini171/sigma/releases/latest) and download the executable for your device
run `./sigma <file>.sigma`

## what is this??
sigma lang was made for our final year computing coursework.  
it attempts to be a very simple to understand and learn, especially for absolute beginners and people who want to pick up programming, but find it too confusing or difficult.

## syntax
head over to [syntax.md](https://github.com/dimini171/sigma/blob/v2/SYNTAX.md) to read more
