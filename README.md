# sigma by dimini171
rewrite of the [original](https://github.com/dimini171/sigma/tree/v1), now more like an actual language than a preprocessor.  
an automated installer will be added soon.

## quickstart
go to [the latest release](https://github.com/dimini171/sigma/releases/latest) and download the executable for your device
run `./sigma <file>.sigma`

## known issues
variables cannot contain keywords, even if the word is completely different

## what is this??
sigma lang was made for our final year computing coursework.  
it attempts to be a very simple to understand and learn, especially for absolute beginners and people who want to pick up programming, but find it too confusing or difficult.

## syntax
head over to [syntax.md](https://github.com/dimini171/sigma/blob/v2/SYNTAX.md) to read more
