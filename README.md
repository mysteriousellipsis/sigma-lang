# sigma by dimini171
rewrite of the [original](https://github.com/dimini171/sigma/tree/v1), now more like an actual language than a preprocessor.  

**this version of sigma is undergoing testing. a stable version can be found [here](https://github.com/dimini171/sigma/tree/v1)**  

## known issues
variables cannot contain keywords, even if the word is completely different

## what is this??
sigma lang was made for our final year computing coursework.  
it attempts to be a very simple to understand and learn, especially for absolute beginners and people who want to pick up programming, but find it too confusing or difficult.

## syntax
