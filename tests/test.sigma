<-- Sigma Language General Feature Tests -->

<-- 1. Variable Declarations -->
new int var count is 5
new string const message is "Hello Sigma!"
new float var pi is 3.14159
new bool var flag is true
new string var name is ""
new int var age is 0

<-- 2. Output Statements -->
print "=== Basic Output Test ==="
print "Integer value: "
print line count
print "String constant: "
print line message
print "Float value: "
print line pi
print "Boolean value: "
print line flag

<-- 3. Input Handling -->
print line "\n=== Input Test ==="
print "Enter your name: "
receive to name
print "Enter your age (number): "
receive to age

print line ""
print line "=== Input Results ==="
print "Name: "
print line name
print "Age: "
print line age

<-- 4. Variable Reassignment -->
print line ""
print line "=== Reassignment Test ==="
change count to 10
print "Updated count: "
print count

<-- 5. If/Elif/Else Statements -->
print line ""
print line "=== Conditional Logic Test ==="
new var int x is 15

if (x is greater than 10) then do
    print line "x is greater than 10"
elif (x is equal to 10) then do
    print line "x is exactly 10"
else do
    print line "x is less than 10"
fi

<-- 6. While Loops -->
<--
print line "\n=== While Loop Test ==="
new var int counter is 3

while (counter is greater than 0) do
    print "Countdown: "
    print counter
    print line ""
    counter change to counter minus 1

<-- 7. Logical Operators -->
print line "\n=== Logical Operators Test ==="
new var int a is 5
new var int b is 10

<--
if ((a is less than 10) and (b is greater than 5)) then do
    print line "Both conditions are true!"
fi

if ((a is greater than 10) or (b is equal to 10)) then do
    print line "At least one condition is true!"
fi

<-- 8. Constant Validation Test -->
print line "\n=== Constant Validation Test ==="
<-- This should fail when uncommented -->
<-- change message to "Try to change constant" -->

print line "\n=== All Tests Completed ==="
